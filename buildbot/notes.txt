To install/upgrade pip3:

python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade

To install buildbot

pip3 install 'buildbot[bundle]'

To create master/worker (but these we've created and committed):

buildbot create-master buildmaster

buildbot start buildmaster

buildbot-worker create-worker worker1 localhost worker1 password

buildbot-worker start worker1



Then go to 
http://localhost:8010


Copy

com.buildbot.buildmaster.plist
com.buildbot.worker1.plist

to 

~/Library/LaunchAgents/

(may need to create LaunchAgents folder)

And launch it

launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.buildbot.buildmaster.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.buildbot.worker1.plist

(this makes it run at system startup)


TODO:
- Figure out how to pass in latest release tag into build script (where applicable) DONE
- Figure out how to limit changes/builds to latest release tag (where applicable) DONE? (remains to be tested)
- Figure out if we want buildbot to do the git work on checking out the latest release tag or if we want the build script to keep doing it DONE, buildbot
