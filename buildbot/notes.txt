To install/upgrade pip3:

python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade

To install buildbot

pip3 install 'buildbot[bundle]'

To create master/worker (but these we've created and committed):

buildbot start buildmaster

buildbot-worker create-worker worker1 localhost worker1 password

buildbot-worker start worker1



Then go to 
http://localhost:8010


TODO:
- Figure out how to pass in latest release tag into build script (where applicable)
- Figure out how to limit changes/builds to latest release tag (where applicable)
- Figure out if we want BuildBot to do the git work on checking out the latest release tag or if we want the build script to keep doing it
-
